Preparing an ontology for viewing:
    Two files are required. The first is the OWL file that has to be verified, and the other file is a
    text file that identifies the new relationships in the ontology.
    The OWL file has to be placed in the data/owl/ directory, and the text file in data/new/ directory.
    To generate the text file, the new RDF triples in the file need to be identified. These RDF triples
    can be accessed by opening the OWL file using an RDF processing library like RDFLib in Python. Once
    The new triples have been identified, the triples should be written into a file, one triple per line,
    and a single space separating each element of the triple.
    NOTE: The file in /data/owl should be named <file>.owl, and the file in /data/new/ <file>.txt. The names
    of the file HAVE TO BE THE SAME, except for extension.
    Once the files have been placed in the respective folders, they will be loaded into the database when
    the '/' route is visited. They are then accessible to an expert.

Generating verified ontology:
    To apply changes based on decisions made by experts, the following command has to be executed:
        python get_verified_ontology.py <ontology_name>
    ontology_name is the name of the ontology file in /data/owl/ without the .owl extension. Once the script
    is run, the new .owl file will be stored in /data/final/. 
    NOTE: THE NEW RELATIONS FILE IN /data/new. WILL NOT BE CHANGED ON RUNNING THE SCRIPT
    The database will be updated to remove those relations which have been decided upon by at least one 
    expert. THE FILE IN /data/owl/ WILL NOT CHANGE.
